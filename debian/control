Description: adb VFS extension for Midnight Commander
 External file system for browsing and editing file system on Android
 powered devices using Midnight Commander.
 Enter "cd adb://" or Alt-C and "adb://" to view remote file system.
 Script will load trees of internal and external storage (/sdcard*, /storage/????-????)
 at first run, so first run will be slow but susbsequent operations will be fast.
 Note: Don't forget to free VFS using "Ctrl-X a" when you want to reload file
 system tree.
